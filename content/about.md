* [ZtereoHYPE](https://github.com/ZtereoHYPE), member

### Our Projects:
* [Initium](https://github.com/zorroware/initium), a Discord bot template written in Java that's designed to make developing scalable and high-performance Discord bots easy.
* [Fabric Optimization Mod List](https://github.com/zorroware/fabric-optimization-mods), a list of mods for Minecraft using the [Fabric modding toolchain](https://fabricmc.net/) that improve performance with little to no compromises.
* [Zorroware XMRig](https://github.com/zorroware/xmrig-zw), a fork of [MoneroOcean's fork](https://github.com/MoneroOcean/xmrig) of [XMRig](https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig) that focuses on bleeding edge technology, high optimization, and maximum profits. It's tuned for performance right out of the box and builds dependencies straight from their Git repositories! It utilizes Clang as a compiler and includes multiple scripts to automatically build it for you. Check out [our guide](/posts/zorroware-xmrig) for setting it up.
