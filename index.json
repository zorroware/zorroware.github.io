[{"content":"The Actual Command dd if=INPUT of=OUTPUT bs=128k oflag=direct status=progress Explanation The flags used in the custom command are optimized for speed and correctness. It bypasses the kernel cache and uses a large block size to get performance that usually outperforms dd\u0026rsquo;s defaults.\noflag=direct makes dd use direct I/O, avoiding the cache entirely, ensuring that bytes are written immediately. This flag almost always hurts performance tremendously, however setting a large block size fixes this issue, and in many cases makes it even faster than with the cache.\nFrom my research, a block size of 128kb (indicated by the bs=128k flag) is optimal for drives, but you can experiment on your own to find the setting that works best for you.\nConclusion Hopefully this blog post is useful to you.
